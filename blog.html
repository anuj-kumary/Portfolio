                <p class="text">Whether you’re interested in becoming a professional web developer or you simply want to
                    learn more about how websites work, the first thing you need to study is HTML.<br><br>HTML is the
                    standard language that is used for creating webpages and web applications. Every time you access a
                    website, a server sends an HTML file to your computer and your browser interprets and displays the
                    information included in that file. In fact, all the information you are reading now is simply data
                    that has been stored in an HTML file and sent to your browser.<br><br>This guide will provide an
                    introduction to writing HTML, examine the basic building blocks of HTML such as tags, elements and
                    attributes, and help you create your first HTML page by following a step-by-step tutorial. By the
                    end of this guide, you should have the basic knowledge required to start working on your own HTML
                    projects.

                <h3 class="heading-third">What is HTML?</h3>
                <hr>
                <p class="text">HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> , which can be a confusing
                    term for many beginners. The best way to explain HTML is to examine the meaning of each word.</p>
                <p class="text">Html is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create
                    dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents. It allows the
                    user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, heading links, and blockquotes for web pages and
                    applications.</p>
                <h3 class="heading-third">Versions of HTML</h3>
                <hr>
                <p class="text">The first version of HTML was developed by physicist Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, and the
                    first publicly available version was released in 1991. Since then, HTML has been updated numerous
                    times to address advances in technology.<br>
                    The current standardized version is HTML5, which has been in use since 2014.</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="text">An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
                    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
                    Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle
                    brackets.<br>
                    EX :<code><strong>&lt;h1&gt; Hello World !&lt;/h1&gt;</strong></code> </p>
